This hosts all my 2021 undergraduate masters research project code on investigating the Afrho parameter of several Jupiter family comets as a proxy for dust activity. This looked at archival ZTF data, which can be accessed using their own API (https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/MOST/instructions.html), which I have written a script to scrape the data of a given target, in a given date range. From there I have another script which actually performs the aperture photometry on the pathway of the files and returns various plots, depending on what is desired of in the output.

This code is messy. I did it in <3 months.
